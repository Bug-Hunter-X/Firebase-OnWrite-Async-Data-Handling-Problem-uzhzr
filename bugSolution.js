The corrected code (`bugSolution.js`) utilizes `await` to ensure the database write operation is fully completed before the function returns.  This eliminates the race condition and guarantees that subsequent reads access the updated data. The code is structured as a Firebase Cloud Function, triggered by `onWrite` events. It synchronously waits for the update operation to complete before returning, ensuring data consistency.
