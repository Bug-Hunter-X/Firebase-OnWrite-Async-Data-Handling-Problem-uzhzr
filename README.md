# Firebase OnWrite Asynchronous Operation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with asynchronous operations within Firebase Cloud Functions' `onWrite` triggers. The core problem is that the function returns before the asynchronous database operations are complete, leading to inconsistent or stale data.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem
The `onWrite` trigger in `bug.js` updates a document and immediately returns.  Before the database update is fully reflected, subsequent reads will retrieve the outdated data, resulting in unexpected behavior in applications that rely on this data.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution using Promises or async/await to ensure the asynchronous operation completes before returning from the function. This guarantees that the data is consistently up-to-date.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Firebase tools: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
3. Authenticate with Firebase: `firebase login`
4. Deploy the functions: `firebase deploy --only functions`
